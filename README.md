## Display modes 

This project has two different *observers* that you can choose from.

By default, the 2d observer is chosen. To change it to command line observer read the comments in main.cpp.

(The command line observer was mostly for testing purposes and isn't entirely finished)

## Controls

#### For playing in 2d:

- `left mouse button` - turn the snake to the left (relative to its current direction)
- `right mouse button` - turn the snake to the right (relative to its current direction)

#### For playing in command line
